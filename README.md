This project is focused on efficient use of WebGL in a React based project. It sjould run cool, and dimmensions of the shader are declared by defining the dimmensions of the bounding box of the <WebGLShader /> component in the page.tsx, and all logic is contained in the @/components/WebGLShader folder.
